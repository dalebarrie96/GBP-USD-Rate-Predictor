I Trained the data using scikit learns linear regression model but im only getting 87-89% accuracy. I was originally hoping to hit around 95% ish since the range is pretty small.

Iv read about a few other methods like support vector regression.. i plan on trying that and if im still not getting the results then possibly look into writing my own model.
